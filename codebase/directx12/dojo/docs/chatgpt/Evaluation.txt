[How to objectively evaluate whether Cursor is actually reasoning better than ChatGPT during dojo sessions]

🧪 How To Evaluate Cursor During D3D12 Dojo

You’re not testing:

“Which one writes more code?”

You’re testing:

“Which one understands D3D12 invariants and failure modes more deeply?”

1️⃣ The Invariant Test (Most Important)

After each belt, ask:

“What invariant protects this system?”

Examples:

Frame ring → allocator must not be reset before fence completion.

Upload arena → memory must not be overwritten while GPU reads it.

Pass system → resource state must match usage.

Shadow map → depth buffer must be cleared before reuse.

If Cursor:

Clearly states the invariant

Explains why it exists

Explains what breaks when violated

Connects it to the D3D12 layer

That’s strong reasoning.

If it just says:

“You must wait for fence because otherwise bad things happen”

That’s shallow.

2️⃣ The Intentional Break Test

After implementing something, ask:

“Give me one controlled way to break this.”

If it:

Suggests a precise violation

Predicts symptoms (debug layer, flicker, crash, undefined behavior)

Explains how to diagnose it

That’s mastery-level reasoning.

If it avoids breakage or hand-waves, that’s a weakness.

3️⃣ The Layer Discipline Test

Every step should identify which D3D12 layers are being touched.

If Cursor:

Blends layers without clarity

Confuses memory lifetime with execution sync

Treats transitions like magic

That’s a red flag.

You want separation like:

“This change is Layer 1 only.”

“This break targets Layer 2.”

“Shadow pass touches all four layers.”

4️⃣ The Minimalism Test

D3D12 mastery = precision.

If Cursor:

Introduces unnecessary abstractions

Adds too many classes early

Creates engine-scale scaffolding

Adds features before they’re required

It’s drifting away from dojo discipline.

The dojo must remain:

Small

Explicit

Breakable

5️⃣ The Debug Layer Test

Strong D3D12 reasoning always considers:

What does the debug layer say?

What does DRED say?

What invariant is being violated?

If responses don’t mention the debug layer when relevant, that’s weak.

6️⃣ The Refactor Pressure Test

After Belt 2 or 3, ask:

“If this were production, what would need refactoring?”

A strong model will:

Identify lifetime coupling

Identify descriptor management issues

Identify scaling limits

Without overengineering prematurely.

🧠 What Cursor Might Do Better

Large structural edits across many files

Fast refactoring

Inline edits inside your editor

Mechanical consistency

🧠 What I Tend To Do Better

Conceptual invariants

Architecture reasoning

Failure analysis

Connecting to long-term engine implications

Explaining why something matters beyond code

They’re different strengths.

⚖️ The Real Way To Compare

After 2 belts:

Come back here and paste:

One explanation Cursor gave you

One intentional break it suggested

One architectural suggestion it made

I’ll evaluate the reasoning quality, not the code formatting.

If you want, I can also give you a short “mental calibration” checklist so you know when you have truly understood a belt — independent of either assistant.
